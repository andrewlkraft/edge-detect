# Edge detect
### Very simple implementations of some image processing algorithms

My inspiration for working on this short project was a [computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_zFhWdM4ic&t=0s)

Links to the learning resources and sites I found helfpul are in the code.

Sample flower image from [pexels.com](https://images.pexels.com/photos/736230/pexels-photo-736230.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500). All the rest of the images were taken by me.

I wrote this code for learning purposes, these algorithms are not at all optimized. I wouldn't recommend running them on large images as it could take a while to run.
